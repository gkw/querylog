Assumptions

[Application Version]
  python 2.7
  mongodb 2.0.4 installed on the same machine with no password configured.
  
[Log Format]
  IP address, and time
  IP address are stored as 8 hex digits charcters rather than 4 integers to save memory/storage space.
  
[Results]

  For example,
  
  Output will be:

  [date]              [ip address]
  2014-03-31 21:42:59 64.12.32.153
  2014-03-31 23:08:37 197.9.152.63
  2014-03-31 23:21:58 236.78.63.23
  1432 hits (1405 unique hits)

  "1432 hits" means number of log that found in the log within specificed time frame
  "1405 unique hits" shows the number after removing redundant IP address whithin a day.

[Scalability]

  Scalable by having mongodb clustered. It is easily expandable having multiple mondodbs. 
  
[Limitation]
   mongodb can store data up to 64 TB.
